sKeybindings
===============

A simple addon to copy keybindings from one server to another, I used this to copy mine from live to the PTR.

Warning: It once reverted my keybindings to the default ones although the keybindings table seemed correct, but maybe you want to try it anyways. - I didn't really look into that, because I don't change servers every day and it worked on the next try ;)

Instructions:

- Use /skb to open the addon
- Click on "Copy Data to Clipboard"
- Login on another server
- Open the addon again using /skb and click on "Replace Keybindings"
